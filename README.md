ASReview Datatools is an extension to [ASReview
LAB](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) that can be used for describing
basic properties of a dataset (e.g., number of papers, number of inclusions,
the amount of missing data and duplicates), converting file formats via the
command line, and cleaning your (input) data by removing duplicate records.

❣️ ASReview Datatools is the successor to
[ASReview-statistics](https://pypi.org/project/asreview-statistics/). ASReview
datatools is available for version 1 or later. Use ASReview statistics for
versions 0.x.

## Installation

The ASReview Datatools extensions requires Python 3.7+ and [ASReview
LAB](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) version 1 or later.

The easiest way to install the datatools extension is to install from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install asreview-datatools
```

After installation of the datatools extension, `asreview` should automatically
detect it. Test this with the following command:

```bash
asreview --help
```

The extension is successfully installed if it lists `asreview data`.

## Getting started

ASReview-datatools is a command line tool that extends ASReview LAB. Each
subsection below describes one of the tools. The structure is

```bash
asreview data NAME_OF_TOOL
```

where `NAME_OF_TOOL` is the name of one of the tools below (i.e., `describe`)
followed by positional arguments and optional arguments.

Each tool has its own help description which is available with

```bash
asreview data NAME_OF_TOOL -h
```

### `data describe`

Describe the content of a dataset

```bash
asreview data describe MY_DATASET.csv
```

Export the results to a file (`output.json`)

```bash
asreview data describe MY_DATASET.csv -o output.json
```

Describe the `van_de_schoot_2017` dataset from the [benchmark
platform](https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets).

```bash
asreview data describe benchmark:van_de_schoot_2017 -o output.json
```

        "value": 104
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `data convert`

Convert the format of a dataset. For example, convert a RIS dataset into a
CSV, Excel, or TAB dataset.

```
asreview data convert MY_DATASET.ris MY_OUTPUT.csv
```

### `data dedup`

Remove duplicate records with a simple and straightforward deduplication
algorithm (see [source
code](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-datatools/blob/master/asreviewcontrib/datatools/dedup.py)).
The algorithm first removes all duplicates based on a persistent identifier (PID), `doi` by default.
Then it concatenates the title and abstract, whereafter it removes all
non-alphanumeric tokens. Then the duplicates are removed.

```
asreview data dedup MY_DATASET.ris
```

Export the deduplicated dataset to a file (`output.csv`)

```
asreview data dedup MY_DATASET.ris -o output.csv
```

By default, the PID is set to 'doi'. The `dedup` function offers the option to use a different PID.
Consider a dataset with PubMed identifiers (`PMID`), the identifier can be used for deduplication.

```
asreview data dedup MY_DATASET.csv -o output.csv --pid PMID
```

Using the `van_de_schoot_2017` dataset from the [benchmark
platform](https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets).

```
asreview data dedup benchmark:van_de_schoot_2017 -o van_de_schoot_2017_dedup.csv
```
