ASReview Datatools is an extension to [ASReview
LAB](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) that can be used to:
- [**Describe**](#data-describe) basic properties of a dataset (e.g., number of papers, number of inclusions,
the amount of missing data and duplicates)
- [**Convert**](#data-convert) file formats via the command line
- [**Deduplicate**](#data-dedup) data based on properties of the data
- [**Stack**](#data-vstack-experimental) multiple datasets on top of each other to create a single dataset

ASReview datatools is available for ASReview Lab **v1.1+**.
If you are using ASReview Lab v0.x, use [ASReview-statistics](https://pypi.org/project/asreview-statistics/) instead of ASReview datatools.

## Installation

The ASReview Datatools extensions requires Python 3.7+ and [ASReview
LAB](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) version 1 or later.

The easiest way to install the datatools extension is to install from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install asreview-datatools
```

After installation of the datatools extension, `asreview` should automatically
detect it. Test this with the following command:

```bash
asreview --help
```

The extension is successfully installed if it lists `asreview data`.

## Getting started

ASReview-datatools is a command line tool that extends ASReview LAB. Each
subsection below describes one of the tools. The structure is

```bash
asreview data NAME_OF_TOOL
```

where `NAME_OF_TOOL` is the name of one of the tools below (i.e., `describe`)
followed by positional arguments and optional arguments.

Each tool has its own help description which is available with

```bash
asreview data NAME_OF_TOOL -h
```

### `data describe`

Describe the content of a dataset

```bash
asreview data describe MY_DATASET.csv
```

Export the results to a file (`output.json`)

```bash
asreview data describe MY_DATASET.csv -o output.json
```

Describe the `van_de_schoot_2017` dataset from the [benchmark
platform](https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets).

```bash
asreview data describe benchmark:van_de_schoot_2017 -o output.json
```

```

        "value": 104
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### `data convert`

Convert the format of a dataset. For example, convert a RIS dataset into a
CSV, Excel, or TAB dataset.

```
asreview data convert MY_DATASET.ris MY_OUTPUT.csv
```

### `data dedup`

Remove duplicate records with a simple and straightforward deduplication
algorithm (see [source
code](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-datatools/blob/master/asreviewcontrib/datatools/dedup.py)).
The algorithm concatenates the title and abstract, whereafter it removes all
non-alphanumeric tokens. Then the duplicates are removed.

```
asreview data dedup MY_DATASET.ris
```

Export the deduplicated dataset to a file (`output.csv`)

```
asreview data dedup MY_DATASET.ris -o output.csv
```

Using the `van_de_schoot_2017` dataset from the [benchmark
platform](https://github.com/asreview/systematic-review-datasets).

```
asreview data dedup benchmark:van_de_schoot_2017 -o van_de_schoot_2017_dedup.csv
```

### Data Vstack (Experimental)
Vertical stacking: combine as many datasets as you want into a single dataset.

‚ùó Vstack is an experimental feature. We would love to hear your feedback.
Please keep in mind that this feature can change in the future.

Your datasets should be in any [ASReview-compatible data format](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format.html).
All input files should be in the same format, the output path should also be of the same file format.

Stack several datasets on top of each other: 
```
asreview data vstack output.csv MY_DATASET_1.csv MY_DATASET_2.csv MY_DATASET_3.csv
```
Here, 3 datasets are exported into a single dataset `output.csv`.
The output path can be followed by any number of datasets to be stacked.

#### Note
Vstack does not do any deduplication.
If you wish to create a single (labeled, partly labeled, or unlabeled) dataset from multiple datasets while having control over duplicates and labels, use compose instead.
