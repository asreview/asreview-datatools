Background: The optimal duration of chemotherapy and bevacizumab in mCRC is not well established. The CAIRO3 study investigated the efficacy of maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus observation in mCRC pts not progressing during induction treatment with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B). Methods: Previously untreated mCRC pts, PS 0-1, with stable disease or better after 6 cycles of CAPOX-B, not eligible for metastasectomy and eligible for future treatment with oxaliplatin, were randomized between observation (arm A) or maintenance treatment with capecitabine 625 mg/m2 bid dailycontinuouslyand bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg iv q 3 weeks (arm B). Upon first progression (PFS1), pts in both arms were treated with CAPOX-B until second progression (PFS2, primary endpoint). For pts not able to receive CAPOX-B upon PFS1, PFS2 was considered equal to PFS1. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to second progression (TTP2), which was defined as the time to progression or death on any treatment following PFS1. All endpoints were calculated from the time of randomization. Results: A total of 558 pts were randomized. Median follow-up is 33 months. The median number of maintenance cycles in arm B was 9 (range 1-54). The median PFS1 in arm A vs B was 4.1 vs 7.4 months (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.37-0.54, p<0.0001). Upon PFS1, 72% of pts received CAPOX-B in arm A and 44% in arm B. The median PFS2 was 10.4 vs 10.4 months (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.7-1.04, p=0.12). The median TTP2 in arm A vs B was 11.5 vs 15.4 months (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.72, p<0.0001), and the median OS was 17.9 vs 21.7 months (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96, p=0.02), respectively. Conclusions: Maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab after 6 cycles CAPOX-B did not significantly prolong PFS2, which may be due to the lower number of pts in arm B that received CAPOX-B following PFS1. Maintenance treatment significantly prolonged PFS1, TTP2 and OS. Our data support the use of bevacizumab plus capecitabine until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Updated results will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT00442637.

AB  - Germline CDH1 mutations confer a high lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). A multidisciplinary workshop was organised to discuss genetic testing, surgery, surveillance strategies, pathology reporting and the patient's perspective on multiple aspects, including diet post gastrectomy. The updated guidelines include revised CDH1 testing criteria (taking into account first-degree and second-degree relatives): (1) families with two or more patients with gastric cancer at any age, one confirmed DGC; (2) individuals with DGC before the age of 40 and (3) families with diagnoses of both DGC and LBC (one diagnosis before the age of 50). Additionally, CDH1 testing could be considered in patients with bilateral or familial LBC before the age of 50, patients with DGC and cleft lip/palate, and those with precursor lesions for signet ring cell carcinoma. Given the high mortality associated with invasive disease, prophylactic total gastrectomy at a centre of expertise is advised for individuals with pathogenic CDH1 mutations. Breast cancer surveillance with annual breast MRI starting at age 30 for women with a CDH1 mutation is recommended. Standardised endoscopic surveillance in experienced centres is recommended for those opting not to have gastrectomy at the current time, those with CDH1 variants of uncertain significance and those that fulfil hereditary DGC criteria without germline CDH1 mutations. Expert histopathological confirmation of (early) signet ring cell carcinoma is recommended. The impact of gastrectomy and mastectomy should not be underestimated; these can have severe consequences on a psychological, physiological and metabolic level. Nutritional problems should be carefully monitored.

AB  - To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.

AB  - Improving the speed of systematic review (SR) development is key to supporting evidence-based medicine. Machine learning tools which semi-automate citation screening might improve efficiency. Few studies have assessed use of screening prioritization functionality or compared two tools head to head. In this project, we compared performance of two machine-learning tools for potential use in citation screening.

T2  - EFSA Supporting Publications
AB  - This Report presents the results from EFSA project RC/EFSA/AMU/2016/01 related to the implementation of machine learning techniques for literature reviews and systematic reviews in EFSA. An overview of the different steps of a systematic review is provided, along with possible ways for automation. Although it was found that most steps could benefit from automation, it was also observed that some steps require more sophisticated methods than those encompassed within the machine learning framework. Availability of data and methodology allowed for the development of an automatic screening tool based on several machine learning techniques. The developed shiny R application can be used for the screening of abstracts and full texts. Properties of machine learning techniques are discussed in this Report together with their most important advantages and disadvantages. The latter discussion includes both general properties, as well as context-specific properties based on their performance in three case studies. Although creating a universal automatic data extraction tool was considered to be infeasible in this stage, this step of the systematic review was addressed to allow the reviewer to scan the uploaded pdf files for certain words or string of words. Based on observations from the performed case studies, recommendations were made regarding which methods are preferred in specific situations. More explicitly, a discussion is made about the performance of the classifiers with respect to the magnitude of the pool of papers to be screened as well as to the amount of imbalance, referring to the proportion of relevant and irrelevant papers. Finally, it was concluded that the results presented in this report provide proof that the developed shiny application could be efficiently used in combination with other software such as DistillerSR.

AB  - New approaches to evidence synthesis, which use human effort and machine automation in mutually reinforcing ways, can enhance the feasibility and sustainability of living systematic reviews. Human effort is a scarce and valuable resource, required when automation is impossible or undesirable, and includes contributions from online communities (“crowds”) as well as more conventional contributions from review authors and information specialists. Automation can assist with some systematic review tasks, including searching, eligibility assessment, identification and retrieval of full-text reports, extraction of data, and risk of bias assessment. Workflows can be developed in which human effort and machine automation can each enable the other to operate in more effective and efficient ways, offering substantial enhancement to the productivity of systematic reviews. This paper describes and discusses the potential—and limitations—of new ways of undertaking specific tasks in living systematic reviews, identifying areas where these human/machine “technologies” are already in use, and where further research and development is needed. While the context is living systematic reviews, many of these enabling technologies apply equally to standard approaches to systematic reviewing.

AU  - Millard, Louise AC

T2  - International Journal of Epidemiology
AB  - Background: Risk-of-bias assessments are now a standard component of systematic reviews. At present, reviewers need to manually identify relevant parts of research articles for a set of methodological elements that affect the risk of bias, in order to make a risk-of-bias judgement for each of these elements. We investigate the use of text mining methods to automate risk-of-bias assessments in systematic reviews. We aim to identify relevant sentences within the text of included articles, to rank articles by risk of bias and to reduce the number of risk-of-bias assessments that the reviewers need to perform by hand. Methods: We use supervised machine learning to train two types of models, for each of the three risk-of-bias properties of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. The first model predicts whether a sentence in a research article contains relevant information. The second model predicts a risk-of-bias value for each research article. We use logistic regression, where each independent variable is the frequency of a word in a sentence or article, respectively. Results: We found that sentences can be successfully ranked by relevance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) &gt; 0.98. Articles can be ranked by risk of bias with AUC &gt; 0.72. We estimate that more than 33% of articles can be assessed by just one reviewer, where two reviewers are normally required. Conclusions: We show that text mining can be used to assist risk-of-bias assessments.
