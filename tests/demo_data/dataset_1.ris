Background: The optimal duration of chemotherapy and bevacizumab in mCRC is not well established. The CAIRO3 study investigated the efficacy of maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus observation in mCRC pts not progressing during induction treatment with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B). Methods: Previously untreated mCRC pts, PS 0-1, with stable disease or better after 6 cycles of CAPOX-B, not eligible for metastasectomy and eligible for future treatment with oxaliplatin, were randomized between observation (arm A) or maintenance treatment with capecitabine 625 mg/m2 bid dailycontinuouslyand bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg iv q 3 weeks (arm B). Upon first progression (PFS1), pts in both arms were treated with CAPOX-B until second progression (PFS2, primary endpoint). For pts not able to receive CAPOX-B upon PFS1, PFS2 was considered equal to PFS1. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to second progression (TTP2), which was defined as the time to progression or death on any treatment following PFS1. All endpoints were calculated from the time of randomization. Results: A total of 558 pts were randomized. Median follow-up is 33 months. The median number of maintenance cycles in arm B was 9 (range 1-54). The median PFS1 in arm A vs B was 4.1 vs 7.4 months (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.37-0.54, p<0.0001). Upon PFS1, 72% of pts received CAPOX-B in arm A and 44% in arm B. The median PFS2 was 10.4 vs 10.4 months (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.7-1.04, p=0.12). The median TTP2 in arm A vs B was 11.5 vs 15.4 months (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.72, p<0.0001), and the median OS was 17.9 vs 21.7 months (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96, p=0.02), respectively. Conclusions: Maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab after 6 cycles CAPOX-B did not significantly prolong PFS2, which may be due to the lower number of pts in arm B that received CAPOX-B following PFS1. Maintenance treatment significantly prolonged PFS1, TTP2 and OS. Our data support the use of bevacizumab plus capecitabine until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Updated results will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT00442637.

TI  - An Overview of the Incidences and Costs of Low Back Pain
AU  - Frymoyer, John W.

AB  - The basic premise of this article is that low back disorders are extremely prevalent in all societies, and probably have not increased substantially over the past two decades. What has increased is the rate of disability, the reasons for which are uncertain. Not only has this phenomenon heightened the awareness of low back pain, but it has led to an explosion in costs. Although a precise estimate is impossible, it is plausible that the direct medical and indirect costs of these conditions are in the range of more than $50 billion per annum, and could be as high as $100 billion at the extreme. Of these costs, 75% or more can be attributed to the 5% of people who become disabled temporarily or permanently from back pain—a phenomenon that seems more rooted in psychosocial rather than disease determinants. Within this overall equation, spinal surgery plays a relatively small role, although the contribution to disability probably has more than passing significance. The future challenge, if costs are to be controlled, appears to lie squarely with prevention and optimum management of disability, rather than perpetrating a myth that low back pain is a serious health disorder.

AB  - Germline CDH1 mutations confer a high lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). A multidisciplinary workshop was organised to discuss genetic testing, surgery, surveillance strategies, pathology reporting and the patient's perspective on multiple aspects, including diet post gastrectomy. The updated guidelines include revised CDH1 testing criteria (taking into account first-degree and second-degree relatives): (1) families with two or more patients with gastric cancer at any age, one confirmed DGC; (2) individuals with DGC before the age of 40 and (3) families with diagnoses of both DGC and LBC (one diagnosis before the age of 50). Additionally, CDH1 testing could be considered in patients with bilateral or familial LBC before the age of 50, patients with DGC and cleft lip/palate, and those with precursor lesions for signet ring cell carcinoma. Given the high mortality associated with invasive disease, prophylactic total gastrectomy at a centre of expertise is advised for individuals with pathogenic CDH1 mutations. Breast cancer surveillance with annual breast MRI starting at age 30 for women with a CDH1 mutation is recommended. Standardised endoscopic surveillance in experienced centres is recommended for those opting not to have gastrectomy at the current time, those with CDH1 variants of uncertain significance and those that fulfil hereditary DGC criteria without germline CDH1 mutations. Expert histopathological confirmation of (early) signet ring cell carcinoma is recommended. The impact of gastrectomy and mastectomy should not be underestimated; these can have severe consequences on a psychological, physiological and metabolic level. Nutritional problems should be carefully monitored.

AB  - The prevalence of mild and severe radiological osteoarthritis was investigated in a random sample of 6585 inhabitants of a Dutch village. Radiographs were graded 0-4 according to the criteria described by Kellgren and Lawrence. The prevalence of radiological osteoarthritis increased strongly with age and was highest for cervical spine (peak: men 84.8%, women 84.3%), lumbar spine (peak: 71.9%, women 67.3%), and distal interphalangeal joints of the hands (peak: men 64.4%, women 76%). Prevalence did not exceed 10% in sacroiliac joints, lateral carpometacarpal joints, and tarsometatarsal joints. Severe radiological osteoarthritis (grade 3 or grade 4) was uncommon under age 45; in elderly persons the prevalence of severe radiological osteoarthritis did not exceed 20% except for the cervical and lumbar spine, distal interphalangeal joints of the hands and, in women only, metacarpophalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, first metatarsophalangeal joints, and knees. Overall, differences between men and women were small except for hips and knees; however, severe radiological osteoarthritis was found in a higher proportion in most of the joints in women. Our data were compared with data from similar population surveys. The slope between joint involvement and age was strikingly constant for most of the joints. Differences between populations were mainly differences in level. These differences of prevalence of radiological osteoarthritis may be attributed to interobserver differences--that is, different criteria used to establish radiological osteoarthritis, in addition to genetic or environmental factors, or both.
